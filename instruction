For the /comments/commenter-count path, the API should return a count of comments from each commenter, grouped by user_email, aliased to commenter_email, ordered by commenter_email in your result. In src/comments/comments.service.js, complete listCommenterCount() to perform a join between comments and users tables here to get the needed columns.

Then, in src/comments/comments.controller.js, modify the listCommenterCount() function to call the service method accordingly and return the data.
